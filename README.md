This repository demonstrates frequency analysis using frequency factors and the log-Pearson Type III distribution as described in Chow et al. Applied Hydrology (1988).

Three analyses are using annual maximum discharges for the following:

1. Guadalupe River near Victoria, TX, from Table 12.1.1 in Chow (44 years)
2. Wabash River at Mt. Carmel, IL, from USGS gage [03377500](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=03377500) (141 years)
3. Tennessee River at Whitesburg, AL, from USGS gage [03575500](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=03575500) (91 years)
